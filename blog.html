    <p>So past this weekend I went to 220 Merill, which is located in Downtown Birmingham and let me tell you guys it was one of
       the best fine dining restaurants that I have been too. They have an amazing selection of food and the vibe of the restaurant
       is very upscale and classy. I ordered there "Truffle Fries" and "Calamari" for appetizers and let me tell you guys the taste was
       impeccable. Now the dinner came which I ordered was "Roasted Organic Salmon", when I took the first bite the salmon literally
       melted in my mouth it was unbelievable. The garlic touch to the Salmon was all it needed and all the flavors came alive when I took
       my first bite. Lastly I topped it off with some dessert which was "Chocolate Carmel Popcorn Cake", I believe I never had something
       like it. The chocolate mousse was just oozing out when you cut the cake. Overall I rate this place a 9.5/10 and definitely
       recommend it to you guys. As I mentioned earlier 220 Merill is located in Birmingham, Michigan which is a very wealthy area so when
       I pulled up to the restaurant I seen some very expensive cars like a Bentley Bentayga, Rolls Royce Wraith, Lamborghini Aventador etc.
       You name any car you like it was probably there that night. Another good thing about the place was they do valet parking there and it is only 
       $5 so thats a bonus. Parking can be diificult to find there so $5 valet parking was not bad at all.The place 220 is on the pricy
       range of things but having it once in your lifetime is a must.
